###### Configuration

# The Most Annoying Part

Time to configure the system. This is the most annoying part of setting up Lifeforge, and there are millions of possibilities that things will go wrong. But don't worry, I'll guide you through it step by step, hopefully.

---

<section id="database-configuration">
## Database Configuration

First of all, you'll need to configure your Pocketbase database. First, you'll have to somehow get your hands on the local IP of your server. Depending on the OS you're using, the command might differ. Once done, you may proceed to fire up the database that you have just downloaded.

```bash
cd database && ./pocketbase serve --http="192.168.x.x:8090"
```

where <code>192.168.x.x</code> is the local IP of your server.

<Notes>
Small tips: place an ampersand (<code>&</code>) at the end of the command to run it in the background.
</Notes>

If you're starting the database instance for the very first time (which you probably are), you'll be given a link in the terminal to create an admin account, like so:

[![Pocketbase Admin Account Creation](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-admin-account-creation.png)](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-admin-account-creation.png)

Head to the link and fill in the details to create an admin account. Alternatively, you can also create an admin account by running the following command (if you feel like doing everything in CLI feels cool):

```bash
./pocketbase superuser upsert EMAIL PASS
```

<Notes>
Make sure to set a decently strong password for your admin account, as the database will eventually be exposed to the public internet.If someone maliciously gains access to your database, they can do **A LOT** of damage.
</Notes>

Once logged in, head to the settings page (the bottommost icon on the left sidebar). In the **Application** tab, there will be two input box at the top for the **Application Name** and **Application URL**. Fill in the details accordingly. The **Application URL** should be the local IP of your server for now, e.g. <code>http://192.168.x.x:8090</code>.

### Import Collections

Next, head to the **Import collections** tab under the **Sync** section in the sidebar of the settings page. There, you'll find a huge textbox prompting you to paste the collection configurations. You can find the collection configurations for Lifeforge in the <code>lifeforge-api/pb_schema</code> directory. Copy all the content of the one and only <code>pb_schema.json</code> file and paste it into the textbox.

[![Pocketbase Import Collections](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-import-collections.png)](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-import-collections.png)

Once pasted, if everything goes well, you should be greeted with a whole list of changes that are automatically detected by the database. Scroll to the bottommost part of the page and click on the **Review** button. There will be a screen popping up showing all the diffs between the current database and the one that you're about to import.

[![Pocketbase Review Changes](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-diff.png)](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-diff.png)

It might look overwhelming, but since don't have anything in the database yet, there is nothing to worry about. Click on the **Confirm and Import** button to import the collections into the database.

And that's it! You have successfully imported all the collections required for Lifeforge into your Pocketbase database. 

### Create User

But, the database setup isn't done yet, we have something else to do. Now, head to the collection page by clicking the topmost icon on the leftmost sidebar. You should see a list of collections on the left side fo your screen.

[![Pocketbase Create User](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-db-screen.png)](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-db-screen.png)

Click on the **users** collection, which should be located at the top of the list. Then, click on the **New Record** button at the top right corner of the screen. Fill in the details to create a user account for yourself.

[![Pocketbase Create User](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-create-user.png)](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-create-user.png)

For now, you just have to fill in the **email**, **password**, **username** and **name** fields. Make sure to check the **Verified** checkbox as well. Once done, click on the **Create** button at the bottom right corner of the screen.

<Notes>
You may use a completely different set of credentials from the admin account that you have just created.
</Notes>

### Setup OAuth Providers

Lifeforge. provides two OAuth providers for users to sign in with: Google and Github. To set them up, click on the cog icon beside the **users** collection name and select the **Options** tab. Under the **Auth methods** section, add the credentials required for the OAuth providers.

[![Pocketbase OAuth Providers](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-oauth-providers.png)](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-oauth-providers.png)


<Notes>
For the Google OAuth provider, you'll need to create a project in the Google Cloud console and enable the Google OAuth API. You can find the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).

For the Github OAuth provider, you'll need to create a Github OAuth app. You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

Make sure to point the **Redirect URL** to <code>\<YOUR_FRONTEND_SERVER_URL\>/auth</code>.
</Notes>

### Mail Settings

Next, head to the **settings** page again and click on the **Mail settings** tab. Change the **Sender name** to your liking (eg. Lifeforge. Support) and fill in the **Sender email** with your email address. This is the email address that will be used to send emails to users (which is you) for the purpose of one-time password (OTP), password reset, etc. Next, check the **Use SMTP mail server** checkbox and fill in the required fields. 

[![Pocketbase Mail Settings](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-mail-settings.png)](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-mail-settings.png)

I'm using Gmail for this, so I'll fill in the following fields:

| Field                      | Value                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SMTP Server**            | smtp.gmail.com                                                                                       |
| **SMTP Port**              | 587                                                                                                 |
| **SMTP Username**          | \<YOUR_GMAIL_EMAIL\>                                                                                  |
| **SMTP Password**          | \<YOUR_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD\> |

<Notes>
You can generate an app password for your Gmail account by following the instructions [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).
</Notes>

Once done, there will be a **Send test email** button showing up at the bottom right corner. Click on it to send a test email to your email address. If you receive the email, then the mail settings are configured correctly.

[![Pocketbase Test Email](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-send-test-email.png)](/assets/configurations/pocketbase-send-test-email.png)

And that's it! You have successfully configured your Pocketbase database. Now, let's move on to the frontend configuration.
</section>

<section id="backend-configuration">
## Backend Configuration

Next, navigate to the <code>lifeforge-api</code> directory that you cloned earlier. You'll see a file named <code>.env.example</code> in the <code>.env</code> directory. Copy this file and rename it to <code>.env.local</code>. Open it in your favourite text editor and fill in the following fields:

| Field           | Value                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MASTER_KEY**  | A random string that you can generate using a password generator. This key is used to encrypt sensitive data. |
| **PB_HOST**     | The URL to your Pocketbase (Make sure to put the full URL, including the <code>http://</code> prefix) server                                                                             |
| **PB_EMAIL**    | The admin email of your Pocketbase server                                                                     |
| **PB_PASSWORD** | The admin password of your Pocketbase server                                                                  |
| **PORT**        | The port that you prefer to run your server on (A number between 1 to 65535)                                                                |


### PDF Thumbnail Generation

There are some module that utliize the package <code>pdf-thumbnail</code> to generate thumbnails for PDF files. This package requires <code>imagemagick</code> and <code>ghostscript</code> to be installed on your system. You can install them by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
sudo apt-get install ghostscript
```

After the installation, open the <code>/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml</code> file and change the following line:

```xml
<policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
```

to:

```xml
<policy domain="coder" rights="read|write" pattern="PDF" />
```
    
Then, without needing to restart the server, you should be able to generate thumbnails for PDF files.

### CORS Configuration

The server is configured to only accept requests from specific whitelisted origins. In the api server, you can find a file named <code>corsAllowedOrigins.example.ts</code> in the <code>src/constants</code> directory. Copy this file and rename it to <code>corsAllowedOrigins.ts</code>. It's a simple TypeScript file that exports an array of strings. Fill in the array with the origins that you want to whitelist.

```typescript
export const CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:5173",
    ...
];
```

Finally, you can start the dev server by running the following command:

```bash
bun dev
```

If everything goes well, you should see the following message in the terminal:

```plaintext
Server is running on port XXXX
```

where <code>XXXX</code> should be the port that you have set in the <code>.env.local</code> file.

[![Lifeforge API Server](/assets/configurations/api-running.png)](/assets/configurations/api-running.png)

<Notes>
If you don't plan to develop the API server, you can run the <code>bun start</code> to start the server in production mode.
</Notes>

And that's it! You have successfully configured your Lifeforge API server. Now, let's move on to the frontend configuration.
</section>

<section id="frontend-configuration">
## Frontend Configuration

This is the last step towards setting up your Lifeforge system. Navigate to the <code>lifeforge</code> directory that you cloned earlier. You will find a <code>.env.example</code> file in the root directory. Copy this file and rename it to <code>.env.local</code>. There is only one field that you need to fill in: 

| Field           | Value                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VITE_API_HOST**  | The URL to your Lifeforge API server. This should be the URL that your API server is running on. (Make sure to put full URL, including the <code>http(s)://</code>prefix) |

<Notes>
For the Google API key, you might have to search up how to generate one from the Google Cloud console. It won't be covered in this documentation. Make sure to enable the Google Maps and Google Fonts API for the key.
</Notes>

Finally, you can start the dev server by running the following command:

```bash
bun dev
```
