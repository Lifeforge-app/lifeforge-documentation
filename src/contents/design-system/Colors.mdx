## Light and Dark Theme

The light and dark theme is a system-wide setting that changes the color scheme of your system. The light theme uses light colors for the background and dark colors for the text, while the dark theme uses dark colors for the background and light colors for the text. Although both themes look good, the dark theme is easier on the eyes and is recommended for use in low-light environments.
