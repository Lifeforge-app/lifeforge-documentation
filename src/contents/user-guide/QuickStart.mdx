# Basic Know-How of the System

As an all-in-one personal management system, LifeForge is designed to help you manage your daily life more efficiently. Before you start using LifeForge, it's important to understand the basic concepts and features of the system.

## Login Screen

When you open LifeForge, the very first thing you'll see is the login screen. Unlike those public services, Lifeforge frontend UI doesn't have a registration form. The only account you can use to log in is the account you've created in the database dashboard.

Once logged in successfully, you'll be redirected to the dashboard, where you journey with LifeForge begins.

If you have OAuth2 providers set up in the database, there will be a button for each provider below the login button for you to log in with.

## Dashboard

When logged in, every time you fire up LifeForge, you'll be greeted with the dashboard. The dashboard contains a bunch of widgets that display various information and functionalities. You can customize the dashboard by adding or removing widgets to suit your needs.

There, you can put widgets that display your calendar, to-do list, weather forecast, or any other information you want to see at a glance, or widgets that provide functionalities like creating a new task or event, and adjust the layout however you like.

Here is an example of my own dashboard layout:

Of course, you won't see the dashboard populated with widgets like mine when you first log in. In fact, it will be empty. You'll need to add widgets to the dashboard yourself.

For detailed guide on how to manage widgets, refer to [The Dashboard Guide](/user-guide/dashboard).

<section id="modules">
## Modules

LifeForge is designed to be modular, meaning you can install and enable different modules to add functionalities to the system. Modules can be anything from a simple utility tool to a complex application. You can enable module that you need and disable those you don't in the **Modules** page, which is accessible from the sidebar.
