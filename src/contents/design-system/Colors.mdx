# Make Your System Look Good

Colors are an essential part of giving your system a unique look and feel. Lifeforge comes with a set of predefined colors that you can use to style your system. There are also 5 variants of background color from warm to cold that you can choose from. And of course, you can choose whether you want to use a light or dark theme. Additionally, you now have full control over your system's color scheme, allowing you to customize both background and accent colors freely.

## Light and Dark Theme

The light and dark theme is a system-wide setting that changes the color scheme of your system. The light theme uses light colors for the background and dark colors for the text, while the dark theme uses dark colors for the background and light colors for the text. Although both themes look good, the dark theme is easier on the eyes and is recommended for use in low-light environments.

## Accent Color

There are currently 18 predefined colors inspired by Material UI that you can choose from to use as the accent color of your system. The accent color is used to highlight important elements of your system, such as buttons, links, and other interactive elements. Feel free to choose the color that best suits your style.

<div className="grid grid-cols-6 gap-6 mt-8">
{[
  'red', 'pink', 'purple', 'deep-purple', 'indigo', 'blue', 'light-blue', 'cyan',
  'teal', 'green', 'light-green', 'lime', 'yellow', 'amber', 'orange', 'deep-orange', 'brown', 'grey'
].map((color, index) => (
  <div key={index} className="flex flex-col items-center">
    <div className={`w-16 h-16 rounded-full theme-${color} bg-custom-500`}></div>
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">{color}</span>
  </div>
))}
</div>

Of course, if you don't like any of the predefined colors, there is a **Custom color** option at the end of the list. You can use this option to choose any color you want for the accent color of your system.
