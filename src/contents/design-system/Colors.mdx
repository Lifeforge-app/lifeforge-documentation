# Make Your System Look Good

Colors are an essential part of giving your system a unique look and feel. Lifeforge comes with a set of predefined colors that you can use to style your system. There are also 5 variants of background color from warm to cold that you can choose from. And of course, you can choose whether you want to use a light or dark theme.

## Light and Dark Theme

The light and dark theme is a system-wide setting that changes the color scheme of your system. The light theme uses light colors for the background and dark colors for the text, while the dark theme uses dark colors for the background and light colors for the text. Although both themes look good, the dark theme is easier on the eyes and is recommended for use in low-light environments.

## Accent Color

There are currently 18 predefined colors inspired by Material UI that you can choose from to use as the accent color of your system. The accent color is used to highlight important elements of your system, such as buttons, links, and other interactive elements. Feel free to choose the color that best suits your style.

  'red', 'pink', 'purple', 'deep-purple', 'indigo', 'blue', 'light-blue', 'cyan',
  'teal', 'green', 'light-green', 'lime', 'yellow', 'amber', 'orange', 'deep-orange', 'brown', 'grey'
].map((color, index) => (
  <div key={index} className="flex flex-col items-center">
    <div className={`w-16 h-16 rounded-full theme-${color} bg-custom-500`}></div>
    <span className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">{color}</span>
  </div>
))}

## Future Improvements

In the current stage of development, the colors that user can choose from are quite limited. In the future, I plan to add a feature that allows users take full control of their system's color scheme. Users will be able to choose any color they want for the background and the accent color. This feature will give users the ability to create a truly unique look and feel for their system.

However, this feature requires a full rewrite of the CSS mechanism of the system. This is a big task and will take some time to complete. But I believe that it will be worth it in the end.
