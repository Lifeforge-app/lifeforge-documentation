## Choosing Icons

There are several modules that requires you to select icons when you are creating or editing the data inside. In the data creation form, there will be an icon picker window that you can use to select the icon that you want to use for the data, which can be opened by clicking on the dropdown button next to the corresponding icon input field.

The icon picker window provides a search bar that you can use to search for the icon that you want to use. You can also filter the icons by the icon set that they belong to. Once you have found the icon that you want to use, you can click on it to select it. The icon will then be displayed in the icon picker.
