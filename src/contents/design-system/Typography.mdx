# A Great Font Can Make a Huge Difference


Typography plays a crucial role in making your system look good. Currently, Lifeforge uses the [Wix Madefor Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Wix+Madefor+Text) font as the default font for the system. This font is designed and adapted by Wix to be used in their website builder. It is a modern and clean font that is easy to read and looks good on both light and dark backgrounds.

Thanks to the Web Font API from Google Fonts, you can easily change the font of the system to any font that is available on Google Fonts. To change the font, head to the Personalization page and scroll down to the **Font Style** section. You can then select the font that you want to use for the system. The font will be applied to the entire system.

If you want to see a more detailed preview of the font, you can head to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and search for the font that you want to use. After you have found the font that suits your taste, you can head back to the Personalization page and select the font from the dropdown list.
