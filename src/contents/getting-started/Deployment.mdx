###### Deployment
# Make it Available Anywhere You Go

Now that you have successfully set up your Lifeforge system, it's time to deploy it to a server so that you can access it from anywhere. In this guide, I'll show you how to deploy Lifeforge to a cloud server using Vercel and Render, but you can also deploy it to any other cloud server that supports Node.js applications.

## Deploying Frontend

Login to your Vercel account and create a new project. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy the frontend repository. Make sure to copy and paste the environment variables from your <code>.env</code> file to the Vercel dashboard.

Wait for the deployment to finish, and you should see a link to your Lifeforge frontend. Click on it, and you should be able to access your Lifeforge system. If you want to use a custom domain, you can set it up in the Vercel settings.

## Deploying Backend

Since serverless functions are expensive as hell, we'll create a proxy server that redirects requests to the backend API that you are running on your local server. This way, you can save a lot of money and still have a fast and reliable backend.

Before we start, make sure you have setup the port forwarding on your router to forward the port that your backend API is running on to the public internet. This is necessary for the proxy server to work.

Next, clone the proxy server repository that I have created for you:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melvinchia3636/lifeforge-api-proxy.git
```

Then, navigate to the <code>lifeforge-proxy</code> directory and create a <code>.env</code> file. Fill in the following fields:

| Field                      | Description                                                                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TARGET_URL**                | The public URL of your backend API server (Make sure to put the full URL, including the <code>http(s)://</code> prefix) |

Finally, deploy the proxy server to Render or any other cloud server that supports Node.js applications. Make sure to copy and paste the environment variables from your <code>.env</code> file to the server dashboard.

Once the deployment is complete, you should see a link to your proxy server. Click on the link and make sure that the server is running correctly. If everything is working fine, make sure to update the <code>VITE_API_HOST</code> field in your frontend <code>.env</code> file to the URL of your proxy server.

## Deploying Database

Well, you can just let the database run on your local server. But if you really want to deploy it to a cloud server, there might be several ways to do it, which I'm not going to cover in this guide. 

As for the file storage, Pocketbase provides option for you to store you files in the cloud in the form of an S3 bucket. Head to the Pocketbase settings page and under the File Storage section, you can switch the file storage to S3 and fill in the necessary fields to connect to your S3 bucket.

And wallah! You have successfully deployed your Lifeforge system to a cloud server. Now you can access your Lifeforge system from anywhere in the world. Time to start managing your life like a pro!

If you're finding the system not to your liking and you just so happen to be a web developer, you can also create your own modules and contribute to the project.
