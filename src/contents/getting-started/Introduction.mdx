## The Back Story

Back in 2023, towards the end of the year, when I was still sinking into my pool of unfinished little projects, life was... okay, to say the least. But my portfolio, even though it contains dozens of projects, still looks pretty naive as most of the projects are small to medium sized. I hadn't let go of the idea of creating a large project since then... until that day.

It was just a normal day, lying on my bed after dinner, scrolling through YouTube shorts. It wasn't until I stumbled across a short film showing a scene of a pilot in the cockpit of a commercial airliner that I was taken aback. I was absolutely amazed at the complexity of the cockpit and the fact that the entire plane is controlled by all these buttons and switches in the cockpit. In a split second, I had an idea: what if I created a system that helped me take control of my life, just like the cockpit controls the airplane?

And the rest was history. I started a new project and started spamming code like crazy. Without me realizing it, this project was pushed into production and is now mostly functional and used by myself to manage various aspects of my life.

## The Current Stage

Fast forward almost one and a half years later, the project is still in active development stage. From conception to actual realization, I was on my own the whole time. Despite the difficulties, I had a lot of fun and the feeling of having achieved something. Fortunately, this project is slowly but surely gaining attentions from people around the world. Hopefully in the foreseeable future, there'll be a community of developers built for this project.

This project is modular, meaning that each function is its own separate module. As the current code base is well established and structured, it doesn't take long before a new module is developed. Nevertheless, there are still many parts waiting to be finalized and reworked, and I will definitely keep working on them.

## The Future

A good beginning is half done. Now that half is done, i.e. the basis of the system, it is time for the system to become bigger. As the saying goes: many hands make light work. What one can achieve is always limited. If you are reading this documentation and are a web developer, I call on you to contribute to this project. Let us make the system the next Notion, but better!

## But Wait...

Did I just mention notion? The absolute GOAT for personal management? Why should you choose Lifeforge instead of Notion? Notion is good, but it has its downsides. First, unlike the completely open sourced Lifeforge, it's a closed sourced program, which means you have absolutely no idea what it's doing with your data. Secondly, it gives you too many customization options, which are sometimes a bit too overwhelming, and you will end up spending more time customizing your system than actually using it. So if you are just looking for a simple but powerful system for personal management, Lifeforge is for you.
