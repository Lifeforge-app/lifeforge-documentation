###### Dashboard

# Your Life Mission Control Center

Every good system has a dashboard, and LifeForge is no exception. The dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in to the system, and it will be the first thing you see every time you open the system. The dashboard is designed to give you a quick overview of your life, displaying various widgets that show you important information and provide quick access to essential functionalities.

## Managing Widgets

Clicking on the three dots at the top right corner of the dashboard screen, there will be a dropdown menu with two options: **Manage Widgets** and **Unlock/lock Layout**. Click on **Manage Widgets** to open the widget management modal.

    <img src="/assets/user-dashboard/widget-management.png" alt="Widget Management" className="w-[70%] rounded-lg" />
</div>

<Notes>
The widgets available in the widget management modal are determined by the widgets provided by the modules you have installed and enabled in the system. If you don't see the widget you want, you might need to install or enable the module that provides the widget.
</Notes>

In the widget management modal, there will be a list of available widgets that you can add to the dashboard. Click on the switch next to the widget name to add or remove the widget from the dashboard. Once done, close the modal, and you will see the widgets appear on the dashboard.

## Adjusting Layout

It should look quite messy as all the widgets are simply listed one after another. To organize the widgets, click on **Unlock Layout** in the dropdown menu to enter the layout editing mode. You can now drag and drop the widgets to rearrange them on the dashboard. To resize them, click on the little triangle at the bottom right corner of the widget and drag it to adjust them to your liking, as marked by the circles in the image below.
