###### Modules

# The Heart of LifeForge

Modules are the building blocks of LifeForge. They are the functionalities that you can add to the system to enhance its capabilities. Modules can be anything from a simple utility tool to a complex application. You can install and enable modules that you need and disable those you don't in the **Modules** page, which is accessible from the sidebar.

<Notes>
Since the system is still in development, there are a lot of information that I can't provide at the moment. But I'll try my best to give you a general idea of how the modules work and will work in the future.

## Module List

The module list page is where you can see all the modules available in the system, which is located at the bottommost of the sidebar under the **Settings** section.

The modules are categorized into different groups, such as **Productivity**, **Lifestyle**, **Utilities**, and more. You can browse through the modules, and, with a flip of a switch, enable or disable the modules as you wish.

## Installing Modules

At the current stage of the system, all of the available modules are already listed in the module list page. But very soon, hopefully within the next few months or so, you'll be able to install modules from the Lifeforge module store, where you can find modules created by other developers, and even publish your own modules for others to use.

## Configuring Modules

Some modules might have configurations that you can adjust to suit your needs. Currently, there are no options to configure the modules, but in the future, you'll be able to configure the modules by clicking on the cog icon next to the module name in the module list page.

## For Fellow Developers

If you're a developer and you want to create your own modules for LifeForge, it's pretty straightforward. Head to the [Module Development Guide](/developer-guide/module-development) for a comprehensive guide on how to create a module and add it to the system.
